Can I have another slice of my favorite Neapolitan Pizza at
Ristorante Da Maria in San Jose, Campbell and Los Gatos?
Delicious food to take out or eat in.  So far, salad and pizza. 
I canâ€™t wait to try other dishes. Awesome! 

George Keshek is truly a happy man, he loves what he does, and he is good at it!
