*This article was written in response to “Our Drinking Problem” in the May issue of
Prevention Magazine. It was about women drinking dangerous amounts of alcohol
and then being able to stop or dial back the drinking. My inspiration for the article is
Eckhart Tolle’s book “A New Earth” and my own understanding of nutrition and
mental health. I have been a reader of Prevention, on and off, for many years and
knew I could submit a blog article. Here it is:*

I believe we are on a journey to find out who we really are. We are meant to live
congruently, knowing what we were meant to do and be, and be happy. When we
are on this journey, there are bumps in the road, sometimes we over drink or over
eat to try to feel happy again. Both food and wine are plentiful and fairly easy to get
so it is understandable that we would choose that. What if we maximized nutrition
instead, we might be able to give up the over drinking and over eating.


As a young mom, I worked full time. My husband took over much of the
responsibility of running the home and supported me to work. My income made a
difference in the budget, I enjoyed making a contribution and I was happy. I told
myself, moms with young kids don’t over drink because someone has to be able to
drive, if anybody needs to go to the hospital. I think now, I was just happy and didn’t
need to over drink.


As my son grew, I continued to work. I still generally enjoyed working and making a
contribution. I thought I would be a teacher, but when I graduated from college,
there were no teaching jobs. I realized, that part of being a mom is being a teacher
and trainer and my son was a willing participant. I was happy.


When my son graduated from high school, he had been accepted by UCLA. My
husband and I made a commitment to support him during college so he could
graduate debt free. I was happy but that was starting to change.


As my role of mom was changing so was my tolerance for working for bad bosses. A
bad boss is someone who doesn’t respect me. Some over drinking started.


In 2008, my husband and I moved to Colorado. I was able to have my own business
and I chose a high-quality nutrition product. I learned how to network with other
women during that time period. I loved getting to know the women and their
stories. The business model was a tough sell and I knew I couldn’t make a living
selling high-quality nutrition.


In 2011, my husband was fired from the company where he had worked for 23
years. Yikes! In a mad scramble, we took training in Real Estate Investing and got
our house ready to sell. We were moving back to California and into the home in
which my husband grew up. His parents were in assisted living and it was vacant. I
think it was difficult for my husband to be in this house at that time. Both of his
parents, who I also loved, passed away during this time. They had long and
productive lives, but we still grieved.


In February, 2014, my sister-in-law passed away from pancreatic cancer. My
brother immediately moved to Minnesota for a woman. That relationship was
doomed from the start. My brother had nursed his wife until she died. He wasn’t
trained and it was stressful time for him. He returned to our California home in July of 2016. We all participated in over drinking trying to fast-track our grieving process.
It didn’t work. We were in heavy grief, occasionally over drinking and trying to
improve our nutrition.


In the summer of 2017, my real estate business started to take hold. I had become
licensed in 2013. I knew I had found a career that I found satisfying on many levels.
I am a team player and a teacher and found I value other realtors . This is a perfect
combination for building an awesome business. Over drinking was still occasionally
taking place but I was needing it less and less. So, in early spring 2018, my brother
got a job at a grocery store as a wine clerk. He works part time and has helped us
improve our nutrition.


We are all living congruently, and we are happy. We are free of the depression we
experienced over the last few years. We have plans and are excited for the future.
My brother is probably ready to find another relationship. He recently had a woman
in line in front of him at the grocery store, and she started shaking her butt at him!
It brought to mind exotic bird-mating rituals!
