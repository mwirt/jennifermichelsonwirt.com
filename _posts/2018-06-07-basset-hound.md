Chloe was the runt of the litter. We drove out to Tracy to meet her breeder and
exchange the fee to purchase for a small, vulnerable, female Basset Hound. We
drove to pick up our son with the puppy in the car for a surprise. He was delighted.
So much so, he, after graduating from UCLA and moving to Chicago, adopted his own
Basset Hound, Charles. Charles was so handsome, he was featured in dog
magazines! But this is about Chloe.


Shortly after getting her we were invited to go to a beach gathering with several
close friends. They identified a place near Pescadero for celebrating Labor Day
weekend. We headed out with Chloe in the car with the top down. She was
terrified. She tried to make herself so small on the floor of the car. She had a way of
looking at you and expressing vulnerability with her eyes. I made her a silent, but
firm commitment, to protect her, no matter what happened. 30 minutes later, we
arrived with the top up on the car, at the beach. Chloe, having recovered nicely,
went back to being a dog and stole a steak off of a friend’s plate!
In 2008, my husband, Ken was offered a job in Colorado with his employer, Charles
Schwab & Co Inc.. We drove to Colorado with both of our dogs, Chloe and Beatrice.
Beatrice was a Basset/Black Lab mix.


We stayed in hotels that allowed dogs. It felt strange to take our dogs up in a
carpeted elevator to our hotel room. When we arrived in Colorado, we moved into
temporary housing that allowed our dogs. We were on the third floor with no
elevator. Bea had been too frightened to leave our home in Fremont. She became a
champ at climbing 3 flights of stairs to go out in the morning and throughout the
day.


In November of 2011, my husband was fired from Charles Schwab, & Co Inc. We
took the next 9 months to prepare to sell our house and return to California. We
travelled with Chloe and a cat, Bamboo.


We arrived back in California in August, 2012 to family and friends. Chloe was
getting older, slowing down a bit. We wanted another dog, and found Dexter online.
Dexter is a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. He was about 8 months old and he hadn’t
been adopted yet. We drove out to Yuba City to visit the breeders and pick up
Dexter. He needed an exam by a Veterinarian. My sister-in-law recommended [VCA Animal Hospital](http://pets.vcahospitals.com/free-first-exam/local‎) in Los Gatos.


When Chloe turned 13 her health took a sudden, shocking turn for the worse. Her
back end stopped working. After two days, we knew we were needing to say
goodbye to Chloe. We made an appointment at VCA Animal Hospital in Los Gatos.
Our appointment, ended up being with Ingrid Peterson, head Vet. She could see
how stressed we were, and came up with a very funny suggestion to ease our pain.
She explained that putting a dog to sleep is humane. We sat on the floor holding Chloe until she passed away. We spent the next 1 hour crying and being
inconsolable and then stopped, knowing we had done the very best for our beloved
dog. Ingrid Peterson is masterful at reading pet owners and communicating
important information.


I have lost pets in the past and had Vets offer to bring them back to life for
thousands of dollars. I left feeling like I had let my 17-year-old cat down by not
having the money to spend on such a treatment. I cried for hours and missed a
scheduled choir rehearsal due to being so upset.


Just this past week, we again received excellent service from VCA Animal Hospital in
Los Gatos. My brother, who lives with us, and his daughter took their Cockapoo,
Muffin, in with labored breathing. Ingrid Peterson, first put their fears of heart
disease to rest. She uncovered the real reason for labored breathing, pneumonia.
Muffin spent the night at a nearby facility. The next day, Ingrid Peterson spent time
with my niece, explaining different strategies to get Muffin to take her pills.
VCA Animal Hospital in Los Gatos offers a free initial exam for your pet. Do yourself
a favor and move to this office because you deserve the very best in care for you and
your pet.
