title: Safeway's Value Corner
---
My brother works for Safeway.  He recently had the “Dairy Guy” tell him that Value Corner Milk was value-priced because the people behind the brand wanted better nutrition for everybody and their children.   Apparently, much of it is organic and waiting to complete the certification process.   Our local Safeway can’t keep the whole milk on the shelves.  Maybe we can support their effort so they can make more whole milk for the building, little bodies that need it.
