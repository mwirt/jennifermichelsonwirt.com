I was born in Palo Alto, CA. I grew up in the surrounding communities of Los Altos Hills,
Sunnyvale, and Los Gatos/Monte Sereno. I graduated from San Jose State University
with a BA degree in Psychology with a minor in Special Education. My husband and
I raised our son in Fremont, CA. During this time, significant changes took place in the
area. With the growth of Silicon Valley, engineers and employees came from many
different places. I embraced the diversity. I understand that the road to get here
isn't always easy. Many people have obstacles and have made sacrifices that we
can't fully understand. I applaud you for seeking a better life. It will be my honor to
help you with any of your Real Estate needs.


And, for those of us that grew up here, I celebrate the South Bay Real Estate market.
